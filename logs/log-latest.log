1. This interaction took longer than 3 seconds to be acknowledged, see https://jda.wiki/using-jda/troubleshooting/#the-interaction-took-longer-than-3-seconds-to-be-acknowledged
2. This interaction could have been acknowledged by another process running for the same bot
You can confirm this by checking if your bot replied, or the three dots in a button disappeared without saying 'This interaction failed', or you see '[Bot] is thinking...' for more than 3 seconds.
To resolve this, try stopping all current processes for the bot that could be responsible, or resetting your bot token.
